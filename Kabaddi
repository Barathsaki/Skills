Kabaddi is a team sport from South Asia.
Two teams are on opposite halves of a small field.
They take turns sending a "raider" into the other half. This is to win points by tackling members of the opposing team. 
Then the raider tries to return to their own half. They hold their breath and chant the word "Kabaddi" during the whole raid.
